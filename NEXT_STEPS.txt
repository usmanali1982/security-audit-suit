ENHANCED SECURITY AUDIT SUITE - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
===================================================

You've requested extensive enhancements. I've created the foundation:

✅ DONE:
- Database models (User, Host, Scan, ScanLog)
- AnsibleRunner class for playbook execution
- Enhanced app structure (app_enhanced.py)
- Ansible playbooks for scanning

⏳ TODO - Create UI Templates:
1. Enhanced dashboard.html (Datadog-style)
2. User management templates
3. Host management templates  
4. Scan status with animations
5. Log viewer interface

RECOMMENDATION:
Since the scope is large, let me start with:
1. Enhanced dashboard with current features
2. User/host management UI
3. Then integrate Ansible
4. Finally add log viewer

This allows you to test incrementally while I build the rest.

Should I proceed with creating the dashboard and management UIs first?
